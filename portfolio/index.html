      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hello! I'm Jane Doe, a front-end developer and designer with a passion for creating visually stunning and highly functional websites. With a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I craft experiences that are both user-friendly and engaging.</p>

      <p>I started my journey in web development five years ago, and since then, I’ve worked on a wide variety of projects — from sleek marketing websites to fully interactive web applications. I enjoy turning complex problems into simple, beautiful interfaces that users love.</p>

      <p>My design philosophy blends creativity with usability. I believe every pixel and line of code should serve a purpose. Whether I’m building a personal brand site or a scalable product for a startup, I focus on delivering results that align with the client’s goals.</p>

      <p>Outside of work, you’ll find me experimenting with new design trends, contributing to open-source projects, and occasionally writing about tech and creativity on my blog. I’m always looking for opportunities to grow and collaborate with other passionate creators.</p>
